### 🙃 About me
🙋 Hey ! I'm Dimitri, I'm based in Dieppe, France, and I'm currently studying to become a web developer at the AFPA.\
✈️ I started my developer journey (recreationally) a few years ago but I've been wanting to become a web developer (professionally) for 2 years.\
📚 I love exploring the corners of the web to find tons of tips and best practices.\
💖 Working on animation and beautiful user interaction is what I prefer to do.
